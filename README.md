# Sudoku Game (Java)

A **Sudoku puzzle game** developed in **Java using Swing**.  
This project focuses on logical thinking and simple interaction, designed to be easy to play, especially for elderly users, while still providing cognitive benefits.

## Game Overview
This project is a Sudoku game built with Java and Swing, designed as a simple desktop application. The main idea of the game is to keep things easy to understand and comfortable to play, especially for users who prefer a clean and straightforward interface.

The gameplay follows the standard 9×9 Sudoku rules. Players fill in numbers from 1 to 9 while making sure that no number is repeated in the same row, column, or 3×3 box. The focus is not on flashy visuals, but on logical thinking and enjoying the puzzle-solving process at a relaxed pace.

From a development point of view, this project was created to practice Java GUI programming and basic game structure. The code is split into clear parts for displaying the UI, handling game state, and generating Sudoku puzzles, which makes the system easier to read, understand, and extend later.

Overall, this project shows how a complete Sudoku game can be built in Java without relying on external libraries, while keeping both the gameplay and the code simple and approachable.
